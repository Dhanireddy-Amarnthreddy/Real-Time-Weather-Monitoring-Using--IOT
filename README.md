## Title of the Project
"Real-Time Weather Monitoring Using IoT" focuses on leveraging Internet of Things technology to gather, analyze, and display weather data instantly. This project aims to provide accurate, up-to-date weather information, enhancing decision-making for various applications such as agriculture, disaster management, and urban planning.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
â€”Using IoT technology along with a DHT1 humidity
 sensor and an element LED display, the system proposes a
 novel way of approaching the weather forecasting system with
 real-time weather data provided based on low-cost and easy
 deployable methods given the increasingly important nature of
 climate change and the rising demand for precise, location-based
 weather information. The NodeMCU microcontroller is able to
 transmit and access the internet, empowering the system to which
 it is connected. The DHT11 humidity sensor is used because it has
 a high accuracy of measurement of humidity and temperature.
 Data scans are continuously being monitored through sensor
 readings. Those data collected are transmitted through these
 sensor readings to a cloud server for proper analysis. In addition
 to such cloud-based.DIt features a prediction of whether it is
 going to rain or not by using NodeMCU, DHT1 humidity sensor,
 Internet of Things technology, and component LED display. The
 system will present real-time weather data in the form of an easily
 deployable and low-cost solution, considering that the impacts
 from climate change continue growing in effects, and thus there is
 the need for more precise and place-specific weather information.
 The system utilizes a NodeMCU microcontroller, which is Wi-Fi
 enabled, meaning that data transfer is through the internet. This
 acquires environmental data using the DHT11 humidity sensor,
 which is recognized for excellent sensing accuracy in humidity
 and temperature. Sensor data are sampled at specific intervals of
 time and forwarded to the cloud server for analysis and storage.
 Apart from the cloud accessibility, this system also contains an
 LED display component.For various purposes including outdoor
 recreation, transportation, and agriculture, it can give forecasts
 related to the weather. This system of Internet of Things based on
 weather forecasting enables it to take a choice based on current
 meteorological data. The benefits of this system include low
cost hardware, simple scalability, and the potential to collect
 crowdsourced weather data. Gathering data from numerous
 nodes positioned in different locations enhances the precision of
 the system while developing more local and accurate forecasting
 capabilities.
